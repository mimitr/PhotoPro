## About this project
PhotoPro is a stock image hosting website that learns user behaviour for a more personalised experience. Users can upload a photo of their choosing which will appear on the web app with a watermarked added across the image. Other users may view this stock photo, like, comment and even follow other users if they enjoy their type of content. If a user really likes a photo, they can purchase the image with a price set by the uploader in order to download the un-watermarked version. Users also have the option of creating collections, either public or private to store some of their favourite photos for later purchase if they wish. 

The app utilises a tagging system for both global and personalised recommendations for photos in the users global and personal feed (Personal feed is also known as the Discovery feed). If a user is active on a photo, either through liking, commenting or searching, the tags on that photo get a boost in score for that particular user. When a user visits their Discovery feed, a list of photos that have the highest score for that user are displayed in order. 

This project is heavily inspired by social media applications such as Facebook and Instagram and attempts to combine the functionality of stock photography platforms with the social and personalised aspect of social media platforms.
